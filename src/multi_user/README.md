The file [generate_voting_statitics.py](generate_voting_statitics.py) contains the code to show that multi-user cooperation greatly reduces the probability of false negatives, as illustrated in the publication referenced below.

We have implemented several methods, indicated by the function name. One of them computes the exact value over all possible combinations, the others apply Monte-Carlo sampling for computational efficacy.
